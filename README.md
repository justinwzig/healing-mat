## Getting Started

You'll need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Bundler](https://bundler.io/),
and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then install build dependencies
with

    npm install

_Tip_: Be sure to commit the generated `package-lock.json` and `Gemfile.lock` files.

Then to build and serve the dev site, run

    npm start

## What's Included

If you want to start creating posts and pages, we've included the
[Jekyll::Compose](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) plugin.

    bundle exec jekyll page "My New Page"
    bundle exec jekyll post "My New Post"
